#### Abstract
This study investigates the effect of payment gap on commercial residential overdue delivery. Using Chinese 174 overdue projects’ data form top 10 real estate firms.
Our findings show that, notwithstanding the real estate enterprise provided a variety of payment approached, the overdue area has a significant impact on overdue. Additionally, we proposed a new financial perspective color clustering framework that could help real estate firms to predict the measure which contractors would take based on clustering and location in China. Furthermore, we find that the different region, color clustering the overdue status are dynamic. We suggest the supervisor department and real estate firms with debt defaulted would base on the principal of ‘new-and-old separation’ widely utilize pre-sale monitoring funds to fulfill the delivery responsibility.
